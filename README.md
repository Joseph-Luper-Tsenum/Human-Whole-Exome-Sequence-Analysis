# Human-Whole-Exome-Sequence-Analysis
Analysis of human whole exome sequence from Finnish female populations was carried out, starting with downloading of raw sequence reads, indexing, alignment of sequence reads to the GRCh19 reference human genome, generating a BAM file, variant calling to generate a VCF file, and variant analysis to identify variants of breast cancer melanoma. The sequence data was gotten from individual exomes from the 1000 Genomes Project publicly available at the 1000 Genomes Data Portal https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample  A potentially pathogenic or damaging variant (Gene: AGRN; Name: AGRN Protein; Variant ID: 1-978577-G-C) was selected for further downstream analysis to gain insight into the role of this gene and the consequences of other damaging mutations in this gene as a guide to predict what phenotype this variant may have in a homozygous individual. Finally, the protein structure of the wild-type protein (AGRN Protein) was modeled to identify the location of the variant amino acid on the structural model followed by the functional importance of this variant region of the protein and how this particular amino acid change may affect the proteinâ€™s structure or function.
